# Adaptive Task Sampling for Meta-Learning

Implementation for "Adaptive Task Sampling for Meta-Learning" on ECCV 2020.

The baseline meta models are based on open-source implementations, as follows:

* Matching Network and PN: [CloserLookFewShot](https://github.com/wyharveychen/CloserLookFewShot/);
* MAML and MAML++: [HowToTrainYourMAMLPytorch](https://github.com/AntreasAntoniou/HowToTrainYourMAMLPytorch);
* Reptile: [Reptile-Pytorch](https://github.com/dragen1860/Reptile-Pytorch).

The code for adaptive task sampling is coming soon.
